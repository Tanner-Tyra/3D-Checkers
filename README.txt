# 3D Checkers Game

## Overview
This is a fully original 3D implementation of **Checkers**, written in Python with Pygame.  
The game features **three stacked boards**, advanced **king and k2 mechanics**, and turn-based logic for a challenging and interactive experience.

I developed this project to explore **multi-layer game mechanics, complex movement rules, and event-driven programming** in Python.

## Features
- Three stacked 8x8 boards for multi-level gameplay  
- Regular pieces, kings, and special k2 pieces with unique movement rules  
- Turn-based system with sub-turn handling for k2 pieces  
- Visual representation using Pygame with interactive piece selection  
- Move validation and jump/capture logic  
- Dynamic display of valid moves for selected pieces  
- Victory detection when a player has no valid moves or pieces left

## Technologies
- Python 3  
- Pygame for GUI and graphics  
- Object-Oriented Programming for pieces, boards, and game logic

## What I Learned
- Designing **multi-layer board structures** in Python  
- Implementing **complex movement rules** for multiple piece types  
- Using **Pygame** for GUI and interactive games  
- Handling **event-driven logic** for mouse input and turn-based gameplay  
- Debugging and managing game state in a multi-board system

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tanner-Tyra/Checkers-3D.git
2. Install Pygame:
   ```
   pip install pygame
3. Run the game
4. Controls:
- Click pieces to select and move
- Use UP/DOWN arrows to switch between boards
